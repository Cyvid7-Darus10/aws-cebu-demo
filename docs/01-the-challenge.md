## The Solution: MVP-First Approach

Ship an MVP this weekend without surprise bills using modern stack with real users, all on AWS Free Tier.

### Why This Approach Works

**Traditional Approach (Fails):**

```
Perfect Architecture → Perfect Code → Perfect Features → Never Ship
```

**MVP Approach (Succeeds):**

```
Basic Architecture → Working Code → One Feature → Ship → Iterate
```
